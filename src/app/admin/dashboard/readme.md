-   Actions (which are server-side functions using the "use server") on forms can be used on forms --> useful for submits
    -   realized it was better to have a onSubmit with the passed function --> more useful for Toast messages when waiting for responses
-   Using closures for generic tables (tools, skills, languages)
    -   for those that use genericVAR(tablename)(vars) --> is generating the returned VAR req then completing function with vars
